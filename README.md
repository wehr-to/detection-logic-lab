# :brain: detection-logic-lab

This repository is dedicated to building **real-world detection engineering skills** â€” turning raw event data into meaningful, high-signal alerts mapped to attacker behavior. It includes Sigma-to-KQL conversions, custom rules for Wazuh, Sysmon, and Auditd, enrichment strategies, MITRE mappings, and lab simulations to stress-test your detection logic.

## :dart: Why This Repo Exists

Anyone can collect logs. Anyone can trigger alerts.

But **real detection engineering** requires:

- Mapping behavior to telemetry
- Tuning rules to reduce false positives
- Enriching alerts with context
- Prioritizing signal over volume

This repo reflects that mindset: not just alerting â€” **precision signal engineering.**

# üß† detection-logic-lab

This repository is dedicated to building **real-world detection engineering skills** ‚Äî turning raw event data into meaningful, high-signal alerts mapped to attacker behavior. It includes Sigma-to-KQL conversions, custom rules for Wazuh, Sysmon, and Auditd, enrichment strategies, MITRE mappings, and lab simulations to stress-test your detection logic.

## üéØ Why This Repo Exists

Anyone can collect logs. Anyone can trigger alerts.

But **real detection engineering** requires:

- Mapping behavior to telemetry
- Tuning rules to reduce false positives
- Enriching alerts with context
- Prioritizing signal over volume

This repo reflects that mindset: not just alerting ‚Äî **precision signal engineering.**

## üîç What's Covered

| Area                    | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `sigma-to-kql/`         | Converting Sigma rules into Azure KQL queries |
| `detection-logic/`      | Custom Wazuh, Sysmon, and auditd detection rules |
| `tuning-and-enrichment/`| Frameworks for reducing false positives and adding context |
| `mitre-mapping/`        | Each detection tied to real TTPs from MITRE ATT&CK |
| `detection-labs/`       | Simulated attack scenarios to test rule effectiveness |
| `dashboards/`           | Sample Kibana, Graylog, and Grafana visualizations |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Sample Sigma ‚Üí KQL Conversion

```yaml
title: Credential Dumping via LSASS Access
detection:
  selection:
    EventID: 10
    TargetImage: lsass.exe
  condition: selection

# converted to: EventID == 10 and TargetImage has "lsass.exe"

## üîß Custom Wazuh Rule Example
<rule id="100012" level="10">
  <if_sid>18107</if_sid>
  <match>login failed for user 'sa'</match>
  <description>Potential brute-force login attempt on MSSQL</description>
</rule>
